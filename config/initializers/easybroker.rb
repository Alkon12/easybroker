# EasyBroker API Client Configuration
# This initializer sets up the global EasyBroker client configuration

# The lib/easybroker directory is autoloaded by Rails 8.1 via config.autoload_lib
# No need to manually require files here - they'll be autoloaded on demand

# Configuration will be set when EasyBroker::Client is first instantiated
# Default values can be provided via environment variables:
# - EASYBROKER_API_KEY
# - EASYBROKER_BASE_URL (defaults to https://api.stagingeb.com)
